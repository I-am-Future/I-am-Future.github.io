100 Data Structure Practice Problems
===

> These problems are designed to offer additional practice and do not affect your assignment or exam grades. They are categorized into eight major classes: Array/List, Graph, Hashing, Recursion/Divide-and-conquer, Sorting, Stack/Queue, Strings, and Tree. Additionally, they are labeled with three difficulty levels: one star for difficulty below CSC3100 assignment level, two stars for equal difficulty, and three stars for difficulty above assignment level.

Sorry that the link is valid only in campus network.
