Hi! I am Lai Wei, a master student in [Computer Science & Engineering](https://cse.ucsd.edu/) at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu). Before that, I obtained my Bachelor of Engineering degree in Computer Science and Engineering at [CUHK-Shenzhen](https://cuhk.edu.cn). 

My research interest lies in robotics, deep learning and computer vision, as mentored by Prof. [Ruimao Zhang](http://www.zhangruimao.site/#) and Prof. [Xiaoguang Han](https://gaplab.cuhk.edu.cn/pages/people) in my undergraduate studies. Following my recent work in robotics manipulation safety, I have become interested in:

1. diffusion models for robot planning <br>
2. force safety and calibration in contact-rich robotic tasks <br>
3. multi-modality models for robotic manipulation, especially with Sim2Real transfer <br>


Apart from that, I also have interests in other computer science topics, such as: CUDA and HPC, Reinforcement Learning, Linux systems, and LLMs...

Feel free to contact me and discuss with me about everything!
