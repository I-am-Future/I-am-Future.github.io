Hi! I am Lai Wei, a master student in [Computer Science & Engineering](https://cse.ucsd.edu/) at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu). Before that, I obtained my Bachelor of Engineering degree in Computer Science and Engineering at [CUHK-Shenzhen](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en). 

My research interest lies in robotics, computer vision and embodied AI, as mentored by Prof. [Ruimao Zhang](http://www.zhangruimao.site/#) and Prof. [Xiaoguang Han](https://gaplab.cuhk.edu.cn/pages/people) in my undergraduate studies. Now, I was fortunately advised by Prof. [Xiaolong Wang](https://xiaolonw.github.io/) at UC San Diego. With my following my recent work in robotics manipulation safety, I have become interested in:

1. diffusion models for robotic learning <br>
2. impedance control for robotic arm or even mobile robots (by whole-body control)<br>
3. force safety and calibration in contact-rich robotic tasks  <br>


Apart from that, I also have interests in other computer science topics, such as: CUDA and HPC, Reinforcement Learning, Linux systems, and LLMs...

Feel free to contact me and discuss with me about everything!
