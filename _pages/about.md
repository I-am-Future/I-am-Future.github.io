This is my personal website, currently under construction!

Hi! I am a master student in Computer Science & Engineering at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu). Before that, I obtained my Bachelor of Engineering degree in Computer Science and Engineering at [https://The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](cuhk.edu.cn). 

My research interest lies in robotics, deep learning and computer vision, as mentored by Prof. [Ruimao Zhang](http://www.zhangruimao.site/#) and Prof. [Xiaoguang Han](https://gaplab.cuhk.edu.cn/pages/people) in my undergraduate studies. Following my recent work in robotics manipulation safety, I have become interested in 1) diffusion models for robot planning; 2) force safety and calibration in contact-rich robotic tasks; and 3) multi-modality models for robotic manipulation.
